I am sure learning foreign languages is very important nowadays. People start learning a foreign language, because they want to have a better job, a possibility to study abroad or take part in international conferences. People want to have a possibility to get a higher education abroad or even start their career there. The most popular among foreign languages are English, German, Italian, French and Spanish.

I have chosen English as a foreign language, because it is the most widespread language on the Earth. About one billion people speak or understand English. English is the language of international communication in many areas of life: trade, tourism and sport. The latest results of scientific investigations are also translated into English. Many books of the best modern writers and poets are translated into English. Sometimes, it is the only way to read and understand the latest works of foreign authors, Japanese or Turkish, for example.

Language is a means of communication. We learn it in order to find new friends abroad and get acquainted with other cultures. Some of my friends have already moved to the USA and Canada. They often write me letters in English and I am glad that I can understand them without anybody's help. This communication helps me to learn new English words and master my speaking skills.
